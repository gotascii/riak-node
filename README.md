# riak-node

Experimental event-based [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) wrapper for the [Riak REST API](http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/REST+API). Uses node.js EventEmitters instead of callbacks to handle asynchronous interactions. This project exists primarily as a means for me to learn about riak, node.js, and node.js' event-based programming model. If you think this approach to a riak client is interesting and have comments, questions, or suggestions feel free to yell at me accordingly through your desired social-networking interface.
